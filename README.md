# SALES_DASHBOARD
 This project was based on dataset of a sales store and aim was to find the overall insights of it like which brand is having the highest orders, how many orders are coming from which state, how many orders were placed etc.

 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀:-

✅  In order to perform accurate analysis and fetch useful insights, I viewed the data and came forward to fight with the missing and abnormality in data.
 
✅ After data cleaning , making the data crystal clear for analysis, I took out the basic insights of the dataset with the help of Descriptive Statistical analysis such as 𝗧𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀, 𝗔𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀, 𝗨𝗻𝗶𝗾𝘂𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗖𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀, 𝗠𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗺𝘂𝗺 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗠𝗮𝘅𝗶𝗺𝘂𝗺 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲, 𝗠𝗶𝗱-𝗽𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 etc.
 
✅ Next step was to analyze the data by take a deep dive in it with the help of Pivot Table. I created numerous tables to fetch all the important insights such as 𝗧𝗼𝗽 𝟭𝟬 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀, 𝗢𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗯𝘆 𝗕𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗱𝘀, 𝗢𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗯𝘆 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗵𝘀 , 𝗔𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗔𝗺𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁 𝗯𝘆 𝗚𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗔𝗴𝗲-𝗚𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗽, 𝗠𝗮𝘅 𝗢𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗯𝘆 𝗚𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿, 𝗖𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀

Then comes my favorite step creating a dashboard full of useful insights. I arranged all of them and used story-telling to make the crucial insights speak clearly with the help of PivotCharts.
